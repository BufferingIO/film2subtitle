## Introduction üó£Ô∏è

It is a REST API for film2subtitle.com website built with Python and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) web framework.
You can search and download the latest persian subtitles for movies/series from film2subtitle.com website using this API.

Please note that this is not an official API from developers of the film2subtitle.com website! It is for educational purposes
and personal use only (you can extend it to your own needs) and was built using the FastAPI framework to give you the best performance
and experience of using an API.

The BeautifulSoup parser classes used in this API are exclusively programmed, and you'll not find any similar code in other APIs.
